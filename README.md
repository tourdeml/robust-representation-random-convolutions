# Robust and Generalizable Visual Representation Learning via Random Convolutions

Re-implementation of the ICLR'21 paper ["Robust and Generalizable Visual Representation Learning via Random Convolutions"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.13003.pdf) that introduces Random Convolutions and Consistency loss. This is an interesting paradigm that opens up avenues with respect to shape and texture.

Related research:
1. Shape vs Texture (Add link) (Imagenet paper)
2. Mixup

Adding this to a pipeline that automatically searches for image augmentation would be interesting to see where this augmentation would ideally fit.

# Progress

- [x] Functions.
- [x] Docs, Format code.
- [ ] Add MNIST example with RandConv and consistency loss.
